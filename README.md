# AdventureWorks-Sales-Report
## Introduction
Traditional static sales reports limit data exploration, making it difficult to spot trends, track performance, and gain actionable insights. In contrast, visual sales reports offer interactive dashboards that let users easily filter data, identify trends, and make quicker, more informed decisions. By shifting to a visual reporting system, businesses can improve efficiency, enhance decision-making, and gain a deeper understanding of sales performance, customer behaviour, and product trends.
## Business Question
This project focuses on upgrading the sales report from static to interactive visuals, as requested by the Sales Manager. 
- The enhanced report will display total sales, product performance, customer purchases, and sales trends over time.
- It will also include filtering options for salespeople, products, and customers to enable deeper analysis and better decision-making.
